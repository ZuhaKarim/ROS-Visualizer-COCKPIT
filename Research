### Research for integrating HTML files with ROS
* The very first link which LOkesh and I tried was : http://iguanatronics.com/simple-tutorial-on-rosbridge-and-roslibjs/ dint work.
* http://wiki.ros.org/roslibjs/Tutorials/ActionlibClient These instructions could have worked but I had that port error .
* http://wiki.ros.org/roslibjs/Tutorials/BasicRosFunctionality This link did not work in the start had teh same port error. I changed the port from '9090' to '9091'
by using 'roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch port:=9091'  and changin the port in html code. Now we have a conncetion between ROS and html file. 
Just need to dig a bit more.
